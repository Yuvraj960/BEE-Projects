### Backend Code Walkthrough

#### **Step 1: Importing Libraries**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
```
- **`require("express")`:** This imports the Express library, which helps in building web servers easily.
- **Express:** A framework that simplifies handling HTTP requests (like GET, POST) and responses.

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```
- **`require("mongoose")`:** This imports Mongoose, a library that helps you connect to and work with MongoDB databases. It makes database queries simpler.

```javascript
const cors = require("cors");
```
- **`require("cors")`:** This imports the CORS library.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** It’s a security feature. Browsers restrict requests from one website to another (for example, from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://localhost:5000`). CORS allows us to bypass this restriction so the frontend and backend can communicate.

---

#### **Step 2: Setting Up the Express App**

```javascript
const app = express();
```
- **`express()`** creates an instance of an Express application. This `app` will be used to define routes, middleware, and server logic.

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```
- **`express.json()` middleware:** This allows the backend to read JSON data sent by the frontend. If you submit a form with JSON, this will parse it so the backend can understand it.

```javascript
app.use(cors());
```
- **`cors()` middleware:** Enables CORS for this backend. It allows the frontend (`localhost:3000`) to make requests to this backend (`localhost:5000`).

#### **Step 3: Connecting to MongoDB**

```javascript
mongoose
  .connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/studentSurvey", { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
```
- **`mongoose.connect`:** Connects the backend to MongoDB.
- **`"mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/studentSurvey"`:** This is the database URL.
  - `127.0.0.1` is the local server.
  - `27017` is the default MongoDB port.
  - `studentSurvey` is the database name.
- **`useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology`:** These options prevent old MongoDB warnings.

```javascript
  .then(() => console.log("MongoDB connected"))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
- If the connection is successful, it logs "MongoDB connected".
- If there’s an error, it logs the error message.

#### **Step 4: Defining the Database Schema**

```javascript
const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  studentName: String,
  levelOfEducation: String,
  collegeName: String,
  collegeYear: String,
  stream: String,
  specialization: String,
  address: String,
  aadharCardNumber: String,
  phoneNumber: String,
  abcId: String,
  email: String,
});
```
- **Schema:** A blueprint for the database structure. It defines how the data is organized and stored.
- Here, the schema specifies that each student will have fields like `studentName`, `collegeName`, `email`, etc., all stored as strings.

```javascript
const Student = mongoose.model("Student", studentSchema);
```
- **Model:** A model is created from the schema. It allows us to interact with the database. `Student` represents the "students" collection in MongoDB.

---

#### **Step 5: Defining API Endpoints**

```javascript
app.post("/submit", async (req, res) => {
```
- **`app.post("/submit")`:** Defines a POST route at `/submit`. The frontend will send form data to this endpoint.
- **`async`:** Used for asynchronous code, allowing us to use `await` for database operations.

```javascript
  const student = new Student(req.body);
```
- **`req.body`:** This contains the data sent from the frontend.
- **`new Student(req.body)`:** Creates a new student record with the data received from the frontend.

```javascript
  await student.save();
```
- **`student.save()`:** Saves the student data into the MongoDB database.

```javascript
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Form submitted successfully!" });
```
- **`res.status(200)`:** Sends a success status code (200 means OK).
- **`res.json({ message: ... })`:** Sends a JSON response to the frontend.

```javascript
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "An error occurred!", error });
  }
});
```
- If there’s an error during database operations, it catches the error and sends a failure response (500 means server error).

---

#### **Step 6: Starting the Server**

```javascript
const PORT = 5000;
```
- **`PORT`:** The port where the backend will run. In this case, it's `5000`.

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```
- **`app.listen`:** Starts the backend server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port.

---

### **Understanding `cors`:**

- **What is CORS?**
  - Browsers block requests between different origins (e.g., frontend on `localhost:3000` and backend on `localhost:5000`) for security reasons.
  - This restriction prevents malicious sites from accessing your backend.

- **How CORS solves this?**
  - The `cors()` middleware allows the backend to accept requests from other origins, like the frontend.

- **When is `cors()` used?**
  - It’s applied when the browser makes requests (GET, POST, etc.) from a frontend to a backend running on a different port or domain.
  - For example, in our case:
    - Frontend (`http://localhost:3000`)
    - Backend (`http://localhost:5000`)

Without `cors()`, the browser will block requests, and you’ll see an error in the console like **"CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present"**.

By using `app.use(cors())`, the backend tells the browser: **“It’s safe to let requests from other origins come in.”**
